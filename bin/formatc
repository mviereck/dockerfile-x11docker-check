# Try to run and control a terminal with xdotool

echo "Trying to run a terminal on host sending keystrokes
like ALT+F2 and some terminal commands with xdotool.

With x11docker this is only possible with option --hostdisplay
along with --clipboard or --gpu.

The widespread solution to run GUI applications in Docker with
just sharing '/tmp/.X11-unix' opens a security leak here.

XTEST error messages indicate that the container X server setup
does not allow virtual key presses at all.

If you run with x11docker option --xpra, --xdummy or --xvfb,
you will see the keytrokes in this terminal, but they are harmless
and captured by this X server $DISPLAY.
