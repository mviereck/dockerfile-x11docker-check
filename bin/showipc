# Show available IPC resources

echo "Showing resources of IPC (inter process communication and shared memory).

In a well isolated case, not much should be visible here. 
Especially 'lsipc -m' should have no entries or show container applications only.

Normally docker containers run in their own IPC namespace.
x11docker disables this with discouraged option --hostdisplay 
along with --gpu or --clipboard to avoid graphic rendering glitches.

If IPC namespacing is disabled, container applications might be able
to manipulate host applications.
