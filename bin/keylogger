echo "Running a keylogger with 'xinput test'.

In a well isolated case, keypresses should be visible only if container
windows have focus, but not if host windows have focus.

If no keypresses are shown while pressing keys although
a container window has focus, the check itself has failed.

Message 'X Input extension not available' indicates the use of secured cookies.

Press any keys in container windows and in host windows for checking.
