echo "Showing some network traffic with iptraf-ng

If iptraf-ng fails to start, your container is protected well
with dropped linux capabilities and an unprivileged user. (x11docker default.)

If you run x11docker with e.g. --sudouser or --cap-default, you'll see results.
If you also run with option --hostnet, you can spy on the host network.
